                    In 1891, Salvation Army Captain Joseph McFee was distraught because so many poor individuals in San Francisco were going hungry.
                    During the holiday season, he resolved to provide a free Christmas dinner for the destitute and poverty-stricken. He only had one
                    major hurdle to overcome -- funding the project. Where would the money come from, he wondered. He lay awake nights, worrying,
                    thinking, praying about how he could find the funds to fulfill his commitment of feeding 1,000 of the city's poorest individuals
                    on Christmas Day. As he pondered the issue, his thoughts drifted back to his sailor days in Liverpool, England. He remembered how
                    at Stage Landing, where the boats came in, there was a large, iron kettle called "Simpson's Pot" into which passers-by tossed a
                    coin or two to help the poor. The next day Captain McFee placed a similar pot at the Oakland Ferry Landing at the foot of Market
                    Street. Beside the pot, he placed a sign that read, "Keep the Pot Boiling." He soon had the money to see that the needy people
                    were properly fed at Christmas.

                    The Salvation Army's Angel Tree program provides new clothing and/or toys for children of needy families. Each Angel Tree is
                    decorated with numbered paper angel tags with the first name, age, and gender of a child who is in need of a gift.
